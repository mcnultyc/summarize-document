The first colony was established by governor Ralph Lane in 1585 on Roanoke Island in what is now Dare County, North Carolina, United States.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Following Gilbert's death in 1583, the queen divided the charter between his brother Adrian Gilbert and his half-brother Walter Raleigh. The terms of the charter were vague, though Gilbert understood it to give him rights to all territory in the New World north of Spanish Florida.</p><h2>Amadas-Barlowe expedition</h2><p>The fleet made landfall on July 13 at an inlet north of Hatorask Island, which was named "Port Ferdinando" after Fernandes, who discovered it.The Native Americans in the region had likely encountered, or at least observed, Europeans from previous expeditions. They brought back two natives: Wanchese, a Secotan, and Manteo, a Croatan whose mother was the chieftain of Croatoan Island.</p><h2>The Lane colony</h2><p>The intended number of colonists is unknown, but approximately six hundred men were sent in the voyage, with probably about half intended to remain at the colony, to be followed by a second wave later. For the first colony in Virginia, Raleigh planned a largely military operation focused on exploration and evaluation of natural resources.</p><h2>Voyage</h2><p>The fleet consisted of seven ships: The galleass Tiger (Grenville's flagship, with Simon Fernandes as pilot), the flyboat Roebuck (captained by John Clarke), the Red Lion (under the command of George Raymond), the Elizabeth (captained by Thomas Cavendish), the Dorothy (Raleigh's personal ship, perhaps captained by Arthur Barlowe) and two small pinnaces.On April 9, 1585, the fleet departed Plymouth, heading south through the Bay of Biscay. When the Spanish failed to deliver the promised supplies, Grenville suspected they would soon attack, so he and his ships abandoned the temporary fort.Grenville captured two Spanish ships in the Mona Passage, adding them to his fleet.</p><h2>Establishment of the colony</h2><p>Amadas and his men burnt down the entire town and its crops, sending the natives fleeing.Manteo arranged a meeting for Grenville and Lane with Granganimeo, to provide land for the English settlement on Roanoke Island. Grenville decided that only about one hundred would stay with Lane, which would be enough to fulfill the colony's objectives until another fleet, scheduled to leave England in June 1585, could deliver a second wave of colonists and supplies.</p><h2>Exploration</h2><p>The colonists most likely exhausted their English provisions and American corn by October, and the resulting monotony of their remaining food sources no doubt contributed to the men's low morale.Amadas spent the winter exploring Chesepeake Bay, travelling as far as Cape Henry and the James River. The English also researched where the local Native Americans obtained their copper, but ultimately never tracked the metal to its origin.The colonists spent the autumn of 1585 acquiring corn from the neighboring villages, to augment their limited supplies.</p><h2>Hostilities and Food Shortages</h2><p>According to Lane, Pemisapan was so surprised that Lane returned alive from the Roanoke River mission that he reconsidered his plans. Pemisapan supported the plan and advised Lane that the Chowanoke leader Menatonon was meeting with his allies to plan an attack on the English, and that three thousand warriors had gathered at Choanoac.</p><h2>Evacuation</h2><p>In June, the colonists made contact with the fleet of Sir Francis Drake, on his way back to England from successful campaigns in Santo Domingo, Cartagena, and St. Augustine. However, a hurricane hit the Outer Banks, sweeping the Francis out to sea.After the storm, Lane persuaded his men to evacuate the colony, and Drake agreed to take them back to England.</p><h2>Grenville's detachment</h2><p>Two weeks later, Grenville's relief fleet finally arrived with a year's worth of supplies and reinforcements of 400 men. The fleet returned to England, leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh's claim to Roanoke Island.According to the Croatan, this contingent was attacked by an alliance of mainland tribes, shortly after Grenville's fleet left.</p><h2>Lost Colony</h2><p>Manteo again smoothed relations between the colonists and the Croatan. White reluctantly agreed, and departed with the fleet on August 27, 1587.</p><h2>1588 relief mission</h2><p>By this time reports of the Spanish Armada mobilizing for an attack had reached London, and Queen Elizabeth had prohibited any able ship from leaving England, so that they might participate in the coming battle.During the winter, Richard Grenville was granted a waiver to lead a fleet into the Caribbean to attack the Spanish, and White was permitted to accompany him in a resupply ship. Two of the smaller ships in Grenville's fleet, the Brave and the Roe, were deemed unsuitable for combat, and White was permitted to take them to Roanoke.</p><h2>Spanish reconnaissance</h2><p>In 1590, a plan was made to destroy the Roanoke colony and set up a Spanish colony in Chesapeake Bay, but this was merely disinformation designed to misdirect English intelligence. Indeed, the Spanish greatly overestimated the success of the English in Virginia; rumors suggested the English had discovered a mountain made of  diamonds and a route to the Pacific Ocean.Following a failed reconnaissance mission in 1587, King Philip II of Spain ordered Vicente Gonz&#225;lez to search Chesapeake Bay in 1588.</p><h2>1590 relief mission</h2><p>White was certain these two inscriptions meant that the colonists had peacefully relocated to Croatoan Island, since they had agreed in 1587 that the colonists would leave a "secret token" indicating their destination, or a cross patt&#233;e as a duress code.Within the palisade, the search party found that houses had been dismantled, and anything that could be carried had been removed. At the same time, however, Raleigh was in the process of turning the venture over to new investors.The Hopewell and Moonlight anchored at Croatoan Island on August 12, but there is no indication that White used the time to contact the Croatan for information.</p><h2>Walter Raleigh</h2><p>The petition was granted in 1597.During Raleigh's first transatlantic voyage in 1595, he claimed to be in search of his lost colonists, although he would admit this was disinformation to cover his search for El Dorado. However, it served Walter Raleigh's purposes to keep the matter in doubt; so long as the settlers could not be proven dead, he could legally maintain his claim on Virginia.</p><h2>Bartholomew Gilbert</h2><p>There was one final expedition in 1603 led by Bartholomew Gilbert with the intention of finding Roanoke colonists. Their intended destination was Chesapeake Bay, but bad weather forced them to land in an unspecified location near there.</p><h2>John Smith</h2><p>"In the summer of 1608 Smith sent a letter about this information, along with the map, back to England. It has been speculated that the same voyage could have also delivered a letter from John Smith, although no evidence for this exists.Based on this intelligence, as well as Smith's earlier report, the Council drafted orders for the Jamestown colony to relocate.</p><h2>William Strachey</h2><p>By 1612, Strachey had returned to England, where he wrote The Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britannia, an overview of the Virginia territory. However, Strachey did describe an attack against the Chesepians, in which Wahunsenacawh's priests warned him that a nation would arise in Chesapeake Bay to threaten his dominion.</p><h2>Samuel Purchas</h2><p>"It is possible John Smith related the story of Wahunsenacawh's confession to Purchas, as they are known to have spoken together. Purchas offered no evidence for his claim about the 1587 colony except to state "Powhatan confessed to Cap.</p><h2>John Lawson</h2><p>Although there is evidence of European activity in the Outer Banks throughout the 17th century, Lawson was the first historian to investigate the region since John White left in 1590. Sea traffic through Roanoke Island fell into decline in the 17th century, owing to the dangerous waters of the Outer Banks.</p><h2>Modern research</h2><p>Research into the disappearance of the 1587 colonists largely ended with Lawson's 1701 investigation. Renewed interest in the Lost Colony during the 19th century eventually led to a wide range of scholarly analysis.</p><h2>Site preservation</h2><p>During the 1860s, visitors described the deteriorated "fort" as little more than an earthwork in the shape of a small bastion, and reported holes dug by in search of valuable relics. In 1950, the earthwork was reconstructed in an effort to restore its original size and shape.</p><h2>Archaeological evidence</h2><p>The low value and relative anonymity of the ring make it more difficult to conclusively associate with any particular person from the Roanoke voyages, which in turn increases the likelihood that it could have been brought to the New World at a later time.A significant challenge for archaeologists seeking information about the 1587 colonists is that many common artifacts could plausibly originate from the 1585 colony, or from Native Americans that traded with other European settlements in the same era. Phelps and his team discovered a ring in 1998, which initially appeared to be a gold signet ring bearing the heraldry of a Kendall family in the 16th century.</p><h2>Site X</h2><p>In November 2011, researchers at the First Colony Foundation noticed two corrective patches on John White's 1585 map La Virginea Pars. "In an October 2017 statement, the First Colony Foundation reported finding fragments of Tudor pottery and weapons at Site X, and concluded that these indicate a small group of colonists residing peacefully in the area.</p><h2>Climate factors</h2><p>Specifically, 1587 was measured as the worst growing season in the entire 800-year period. Their study measured growth rings from a network of bald cypress trees, producing data over ranging from 1185 to 1984.</p><h2>Genetic analysis</h2><p>Although it is conceivable to sequence DNA from 430-year-old bones, there are as yet no bones from the Lost Colony to work with. The main challenge of this work is to obtain a genetic point of comparison, either from the remains of a Lost Colonist or one of their descendants.</p><h2>Hypotheses about the disappearance</h2><p>The "CROATOAN" message is consistent with the agreement with White to indicate where to look for them, suggesting they expected White to look for them and wanted to be found. Without evidence of the Lost Colony's relocation or destruction, speculation about their fate has endured since the 1590s.</p><h2>Integration with local tribes</h2><p>People have considered the possibility that the missing colonists could have assimilated into nearby Native American tribes since at least 1605. Although this is frequently attributed to assimilated Lost Colonists, it may be more easily be explained by dramatically higher rates of albinism in Native Americans than in people of European descent.</p><h2>Attempt to return to England</h2><p>Alternatively, the Roanoke colonists could have sailed north along the coast, in the hopes of making contact with English fishing fleets in the Gulf of Maine.The pinnace would not have been large enough to carry all of the colonists. Considering the ships built by survivors of the 1609 Sea Venture shipwreck, it is at least possible that the Lost Colonists could produce a second ship that, with the pinnace, could transport most of their party.</p><h2>Powhatan attack at Chesapeake Bay</h2><p>Following White's failure to locate any of the colonists, the main body of the colonists would have quickly assimilated with the Chesepians, while the lookouts on Croatoan would have blended into the Croatan tribe.Quinn suggested that Samuel Mace's 1602 voyage might have ventured into Chesepeake Bay and kidnapped Powhatans to bring back to England. Quinn evidently believed circumstances such as these were necessary to explain optimism about the colonists' survival after 1603.Although Strachey accused Wahunsenacawh of slaughtering the colonists and Chesepians in separate passages, Quinn decided that these events occurred in a single attack on an integrated community, in April 1607.</p><h2>Spanish attack</h2><p>However, the Spanish were still attempting to locate the colony in Chesapeake Bay as late as 1600, suggesting that they were unaware of its fate. Green's play ends with the colonists leaving Roanoke Island to evade an approaching Spanish ship, leaving the audience to wonder if the Spanish found them.Spanish forces knew of English plans to establish a new Virginia base in 1587, and were searching for it before White's colonists had even arrived.</p><h2>Conspiracy against Raleigh</h2><p>Raleigh expressed sympathy for the Separatists, while Walsingham considered them a threat to be eliminated.According to Miller, the colonists split up, with small group relocating to Croatoan while the main body sought shelter with the Chowanoke. She concluded that the Mandoag were the Eno, who traded the remaining Lost Colonists as slaves until they were dispersed throughout the region.Miller's theory has been challenged based on Walsingham's considerable financial support of Raleigh's expeditions, and the willingness of Fernandes to bring John White back to England instead of abandoning him with the other colonists.</p><h2>Secret operation at Beechland</h2><p>A significant problem is that Raleigh supposedly planned a sassafras farm in 1587 to capitalize on a dramatic increase in crop prices, so that he could quickly compensate for the great expense of the failed 1585 colony. All records suggesting the colony's intended destination was Chesapeake Bay, and that England had lost contact with the colony, were supposedly falsified to conceal the operation from Spanish operatives and other potential competitors.According to McMullan, Raleigh quietly re-established contact with the colony by 1597, and his sassafras expeditions were simply picking up the colonists' harvests.</p><h2>CORA tree</h2><p>In 2006, writer Scott Dawson proposed that a Southern live oak tree on Hatteras Island, which bears the faint inscription "CORA" in its bark, might be connected to the Lost Colony. If so, "CORA" might indicate that the colonists left Croatoan Island to settle with the Coree (also known as the Coranine) on the mainland near Lake Mattamuskeet.A 2009 study to determine the age of the CORA tree was inconclusive.</p><h2>Dare Stones</h2><p>Most historians believe that they are a fraud, but there are some today who still believe at least one of the stones to be genuine. The very first one is sometimes regarded to be different from the rest, based on a linguistic and chemical analysis, and could possibly be genuine.</p><h2>In popular culture</h2><p>"The first known use of the phrase "The Lost Colony" to describe the 1587 Roanoke settlement was by Eliza Lanesford Cushing in an 1837 historical romance, "Virginia Dare; or, the Lost Colony." The same concept was used more famously in The White Doe, a 1901 poem by Sallie Southall Cotten.The popularity of the Lost Colony and Virginia Dare in the 19th and early 20th centuries coincided with American controversies about rising numbers of Catholic and non-British immigrants, as well as the treatment of African Americans and Native Americans.</p></div></body></html>
