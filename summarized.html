Approx. Following the failure of the 1585 settlement, a second colony led by  landed on the same island in 1587, and became known as the 
Lost Colony
 due to the unexplained disappearance of its population.While awaiting a delayed resupply mission by , Lane decided to abandon the colony and return to  with  in 1586. Instead, the  delayed his return to Roanoke until 1590. The word "CROATOAN" was found carved into the palisade, which White interpreted to mean the colonists had relocated to .Investigations by the  colonists produced reports that the Roanoke settlers were massacred, as well as stories of people with European features in Native American villages, but no hard evidence. The terms of the charter were vague, though Gilbert understood it to give him rights to all territory in the  north of . 112-121 colonists remains unknown.It was expected that Raleigh would establish a base from which to send  on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain. Raleigh was awarded the lands to the south, though much of it was already claimed by Spain. Raleigh's charter, issued on March 25, 1584, specified that he needed to establish a colony by 1591, or lose his right to colonization.The fleet made landfall on July 13 at an inlet north of Hatorask Island, which was named "Port Ferdinando" after Fernandes, who discovered it.

Raleigh quickly arranged an expedition to explore his claim, which departed England on April 27, 1584. The two ships then sailed north until July 4, when they sighted land at what is now called .The Lane colony

Sir Richard Grenville


For the first colony in Virginia, Raleigh planned a largely military operation focused on exploration and evaluation of natural resources. Sir Walter Raleigh proceeded to seek investors to fund a colony. was appointed governor of the colony, and Philip Amadas would serve as admiral, although the fleet commander Sir  led the overall mission.Fortunately, Fernandes had advised a plan for such an occurrence, wherein the ships would meet up at Mosquetal, a bay on the south coast of . A severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated the 
Tiger
 from the rest of the fleet, and sank one of the pinnaces. Voyage

The fleet consisted of seven ships: The  
Tiger
 (Grenville's flagship, with Simon Fernandes as pilot), the  
Roebuck
 (captained by John Clarke), the 
Red Lion
 (under the command of George Raymond), the 
Elizabeth
 (captained by ), the 
Dorothy
 (Raleigh's personal ship, perhaps captained by Arthur Barlowe) and two small .Lane took one of these ships to , where he captured salt mounds collected by the Spanish. Grenville captured two Spanish ships in the , adding them to his fleet. When the Spanish failed to deliver the promised supplies, Grenville suspected they would soon attack, so he and his ships abandoned the temporary fort.Moreover, the shallow inlets of the Outer Banks made the region unsuitable for a base to support large ships. After repairs, the 
Tiger
 continued with the rest of the fleet to Port Ferdinando, where they reunited with the 
Roebuck
 and the 
Dorothy
. Grenville's ships then sailed to , where the Spanish set aside hostilities to trade with the well-armed English fleet.Grenville decided that only about one hundred would stay with Lane, which would be enough to fulfill the colony's objectives until another fleet, scheduled to leave England in June 1585, could deliver a second wave of colonists and supplies. Until a resupply mission could be arranged, Lane's colony would be heavily dependent on the generosity of the natives. Establishment of the colony

Assault on Aquascogoc


The loss of provisions from the 
Tiger
 meant that the colony would support far fewer settlers than originally planned.Ralph Lane's Roanoke fort


Manteo arranged a meeting for Grenville and Lane with Granganimeo, to provide land for the English settlement on Roanoke Island. The merchant ship, which Grenville took back to England as a prize, was loaded with enough treasure to make the entire Roanoke expedition profitable, spurring excitement in Queen Elizabeth's court about Raleigh's colonization efforts. Lane began construction of a fort on the north side of the island.However, little information survives about what transpired at the colony between September 1585 and March 1586, making a full assessment of the winter impossible. The colony apparently obtained enough corn (along with venison, fish, and oysters) to sustain them through the winter. However, historians disagree as to whether John White returned to England with Grenville, or spent the winter at Roanoke despite his absence from the list of colonists.Although 16th century science could not explain the phenomenon, Harriot noticed that each town the colonists visited quickly suffered a deadly epidemic, which may have been  or . The colonists most likely exhausted their English provisions and American corn by October, and the resulting monotony of their remaining food sources no doubt contributed to the men's low morale. The Secotans had described Skic&#243;ak as the largest city in the region, possibly leading the English to expect something like the wealthy  and  kingdoms encountered by the Spanish.Pemisapan supported the plan and advised Lane that the  leader Menatonon was meeting with his allies to plan an attack on the English, and that three thousand warriors had gathered at Choanoac. At the same time, Pemisapan sent word to Menatonon that the English would be coming, ensuring both sides would expect hostilities. The death of Granganimeo, who had been a powerful advocate for the colony, apparently helped to turn Wingina against the English.In the meantime, Lane ransomed Menatonon and had Skiko sent back to Roanoke as a hostage. The chief's son Skiko described a place to the west called "Chaunis Temoatan" rich in a valuable metal, which Lane thought could be copper or perhaps even gold. Menatonon also corroborated rumors Lane had heard about a sea just beyond the head of the , apparently confirming English hopes of finding access to the Pacific Ocean.According to Lane, Pemisapan was so surprised that Lane returned alive from the Roanoke River mission that he reconsidered his plans. Lane had expected the Moratuc to provide provisions for him along his route, but Pemisapan had sent word that the English were hostile and villagers should withdraw from the river with their food. Lane and his party returned to the colony shortly after Easter, half-starved and empty-handed.Although Pemisapan met regularly with Skiko and believed him sympathetic to the anti-English cause, Skiko sought to honor his father's intention of maintaining relations with the colony. Pemisapan evacuated the Secotan from Roanoke, destroyed the fishing weirs, and ordered them not to sell food to the English. Left to their own devices the English had no way to produce enough food to sustain the colony.Once they were admitted into the council, Lane gave the signal for his men to attack. On June 1, Lane, his top officers, and twenty-five men visited Dasamongueponke under the pretense of discussing a Secotan attempt to free Skiko. The plan of attack was to ambush Lane and other key leaders as they slept at the colony, and then signal for a general attack on the rest.After the storm, Lane persuaded his men to evacuate the colony, and Drake agreed to take them back to England. There is no record of them arriving in England with the fleet, and it is possible Drake left them on Roanoke with some of the goods he had previously set aside for Lane. Upon arrival, the colonists introduced , , and  to England.Two weeks later, Grenville's relief fleet finally arrived with a year's worth of supplies and reinforcements of 400 men. According to the Croatan, this contingent was attacked by an alliance of mainland tribes, shortly after Grenville's fleet left. The fleet returned to England, leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh's claim to Roanoke Island.Lost Colony

Death of George Howe


Despite the desertion of the Lane colony, Raleigh was persuaded to make another attempt by Richard Hakluyt, Thomas Harriot, and John White. Manteo and Towaye, who had left the Lane colony with Drake's fleet, were also brought along. On January 7, 1587, Raleigh approved a corporate charter to found "the Cittie of Raleigh" with White as governor and 12 assistants.On July 22, the flagship and pinnace anchored at . Once he boarded the pinnace however, a "gentleman" on the flagship representing Fernandes ordered the sailors to leave the colonists on Roanoke. Following the arrival of the flyboat on July 25, all of the colonists disembarked.Manteo again smoothed relations between the colonists and the Croatan. The colonists attempted to negotiate a truce through the Croatan, but received no response. The colonists persuaded Governor White to return to England to explain the colony's desperate situation and ask for help.Two of the smaller ships in Grenville's fleet, the 
Brave
 and the 
Roe
, were deemed unsuitable for combat, and White was permitted to take them to Roanoke. White reluctantly agreed, and departed with the fleet on August 27, 1587. During the winter, Richard Grenville was granted a waiver to lead a fleet into the Caribbean to attack the Spanish, and White was permitted to accompany him in a resupply ship.Gonz&#225;lez failed to find anything in Chesapeake, but on the way back he chanced to discover Port Ferdinando along the Outer Banks.

 and the 
Moonlight
 would split off to take White to his colony. 1590 relief mission

Eventually, Walter Raleigh arranged passage for White on a privateering expedition organised by .Within the palisade, the search party found that houses had been dismantled, and anything that could be carried had been removed. The party returned to the 
Hopewell
 that evening, and plans were made to return to Croatoan the following day. The party found fresh tracks in the sand, but were not contacted by anyone.However, it served Walter Raleigh's purposes to keep the matter in doubt; so long as the settlers could not be proven dead, he could legally maintain his claim on Virginia. Nevertheless, a 1594 petition was made to declare Ananias Dare  so that his son, John Dare, could inherit his estate. Investigations into Roanoke

There was one final expedition in 1603 led by  with the intention of finding Roanoke colonists.The original map is now lost, but a copy was obtained by Pedro de Z&#250;&#241;iga, the Spanish ambassador to England, who passed it on to King . In the summer of 1608 Smith sent a letter about this information, along with the map, back to England. The map also featured a place called "Pakrakanick" with a note indicating "Here remayneth 4 men clothed that came from Roonocok to Ocanahawan."Neither group could find any sign of the Roanoke colonists living in the area. By May 1609, word had reached England's Royal Council for Virginia that the 1587 colonists had been massacred by Wahunsenacawh. These orders recommended "Ohonahorn" (or "Oconahoen"), near the mouth of the , as a new base.William Strachey

Based on this account, seven English&#8212;four men, two boys, and one woman&#8212;survived the assault and fled up the Chowan River.To that end, he recommended a plan in which King James would show mercy to the Powhatan people for the massacre of the Roanoke colonists, but demand revenge upon the priests. However, Strachey did describe an attack against the Chesepians, in which Wahunsenacawh's priests warned him that a nation would arise in Chesapeake Bay to threaten his dominion. Strachey believed that the Powhatan religion was inherently , and that the priests might literally be in communion with Satan.It is possible John Smith related the story of Wahunsenacawh's confession to Purchas, as they are known to have spoken together. Even if taken at face value, the alleged confession is not persuasive, as Wahunsenacawh might have invented the story in an attempt to intimidate Smith. Purchas offered no evidence for his claim about the 1587 colony except to state "Powhatan confessed to Cap.Site preservation

Archaeological research on Roanoke Island only began when  discovered a Native American burial site in 1887. Production of the 1921 silent film

During the 1860s, visitors described the deteriorated "fort" as little more than an earthwork in the shape of a small , and reported holes dug by in search of valuable relics.Phelps and his team discovered a ring in 1998, which initially appeared to be a gold  bearing the  of a Kendall family in the 16th century. X-ray analysis in 2017 proved the ring was brass, not gold, and experts could not confirm the alleged connection to Kendall heraldry. A significant challenge for archaeologists seeking information about the 1587 colonists is that many common artifacts could plausibly originate from the 1585 colony, or from Native Americans that traded with other European settlements in the same era.As the symbol is not to scale, it covers an area on the map representing thousands of acres in .

As of 2019, the project has yet to identify any living descendants either.Integration with local tribes

People have considered the possibility that the missing colonists could have assimilated into nearby Native American tribes since at least 1605. The "CROATOAN" message is consistent with the agreement with White to indicate where to look for them, suggesting they expected White to look for them and wanted to be found. Colonial era Europeans observed that people removed from European society by Native Americans&#8212;even if captured or enslaved&#8212;were reluctant to return; the reverse was seldom true.The present-day  identifies as descendants of both the Croatan and the Lost Colonists by way of the Hatteras. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that, at some point, the assimilated colonists or their descendants would resist efforts at recovery. However, this leaves open the question of which tribe, or tribes, the colonists assimilated with.The colonists could have decided to rescue themselves by sailing for England in the pinnace left behind by the 1587 expedition. was convinced that the colonists had relocated westward to the banks of the  in , and  claimed that after being attacked by Wanchese and Wahunsenacawh, the colonists scattered to multiple locations: the Chowan River, and south to the  and Neuse Rivers. Other tribes purportedly linked to the Roanoke colonists include the  and the .The pinnace would not have been large enough to carry all of the colonists. Considering the ships built by survivors of the 1609 
Sea Venture
 shipwreck, it is at least possible that the Lost Colonists could produce a second ship that, with the pinnace, could transport most of their party. Even in these ideal conditions, however, at least some colonists would remain in Virginia, leaving open the question of what became of them.Following White's failure to locate any of the colonists, the main body of the colonists would have quickly assimilated with the , while the lookouts on Croatoan would have blended into the Croatan tribe. Although Strachey accused Wahunsenacawh of slaughtering the colonists and Chesepians in separate passages, Quinn decided that these events occurred in a single attack on an integrated community, in April 1607.

Based on these legends, engineer Phillip McMullan and amateur archaeologist Fred Willard concluded that Walter Raleigh dispatched the 1587 colonists to harvest sassafras along the Alligator River. According to Miller, the colonists split up, with small group relocating to Croatoan while the main body sought shelter with the .According to McMullan, Raleigh quietly re-established contact with the colony by 1597, and his sassafras expeditions were simply picking up the colonists' harvests. CORA tree
[
]


In 2006, writer Scott Dawson proposed that a  on Hatteras Island, which bears the faint inscription "CORA" in its bark, might be connected to the Lost Colony. A significant problem is that Raleigh supposedly planned a sassafras farm in 1587 to capitalize on a dramatic increase in crop prices, so that he could quickly compensate for the great expense of the failed 1585 colony.A 2009 study to determine the age of the CORA tree was inconclusive. Most historians believe that they are a fraud, but there are some today who still believe at least one of the stones to be genuine. Even if the tree dates back to the 16th century, though, establishing the age of the inscription would be another matter.The 1605 comedy 
 features characters bound for Virginia, who are assured that the lost colonists have by that time intermarried with Native Americans to give rise to "a whole country of English." The first known use of the phrase "The Lost Colony" to describe the 1587 Roanoke settlement was by  in an 1837 historical romance, "Virginia Dare; or, the Lost Colony." He was the first since John White to write about Virginia Dare, calling attention to her status as the first English child born on what would become US soil, and the pioneering spirit exhibited by her name.Celebrations of the Lost Colony, on Virginia Dare's birthday, have been organized on Roanoke Island since the 1880s.
